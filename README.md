IMDB Movie Data Scraping and Analysis Project
Objective: Developed a comprehensive web scraping and data analysis pipeline to extract, process, and visualize movie data from IMDB. This project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in data acquisition, cleaning, and insightful data presentation. 

Key Technologies: Python  with libraries including:

Web Scraping: Selenium (for browser automation), webdriver_manager, and imdb (for IMDB-specific data retrieval).
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express.
Machine Learning/Statistical Analysis (demonstrated capability): scikit-learn (Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, StandardScaler), SciPy.
Data Persistence: Joblib, pymongo.
Core Achievements:

Automated Data Collection: Successfully scraped movie names and detailed information (Release Year, Director, Main Actors, Genre, Rating, Duration, Votes) from IMDB's top charts, handling dynamic content loading.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and ensuring data quality for analysis.

Comprehensive Data Visualization: Created various visualizations to explore dataset characteristics, including:
Movie count by release year.
Relationship between movie duration and rating.
Distribution of movie ratings and votes.
Genre distribution and comparison of rating distributions across different genres.
Predictive Modeling (Demonstrated): Included components for linear regression and random forest regression, showcasing capability in applying machine learning models to movie data.
Data Storage: Implemented data saving functionality using joblib.
This project demonstrates strong skills in web scraping, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization, with a foundational understanding of machine learning application.
